I write a lot of code.

I write unreasonable amounts of code.

I code for work, for fun, and for the sake of it.

In high school, I built a cluster out of computers I found in the garbage.

In college, I started in towards machine learning.  My favorite project from back then was a Galaga-esque game, where the enemy creatures got better through natural selection.

I have about 60 Project Euler problems done, although I haven't worked on them in a while.  I hope to place in my first Kaggle competition by the end of this year.

There's a lot of code that I can't share (student models, etc), but I'd be happy to chat about it with you.  If you have any interesting data to mine, algorithms to analyze, or languages to learn, [send me an email.](/contact)
