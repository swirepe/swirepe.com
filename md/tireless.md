## combat decision fatigue

A lot of times when I (or my friends) have trouble making a choice, we flip a coin.  More accurately, we write some python.

    from random import choice
    choice(["bbq", "sushi", "italian"])

There's been some research saying that people can't make good decisions indefinitely, and flipping coins helps to pull some of the cognitive load off.

Tireless is a combination of coin-flipping and the [pomodoro technique.](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/)  You put in some things you need to get done, and it tells you what to do and how long to do it for.

I got Tireless entirely into one html file, including the favicon.
