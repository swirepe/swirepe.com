# Some things about me

My name is Peter Swire.

I wrote a relational calculus to help optimize my grocery shopping.  That is the kind of thing I do for fun.

I am in a punk band with my brother.  I play a hanna montana guitar, because that's what punk is.

My solo band is called State Machine.

The superhero I most relate with is Desolation Jones.  My favorite is The Tick.

I double-majored in Computer Science and music.

For one of my performance requirements, I was not allowed to play guitar; I had to play my computer with my guitar plugged into it.  I got pretty good at coding new and interesting effects.  If you find me on r/guitar, I'll probably write you one.

I also play the viola da gamba.  It's an extinct instrument that later went on to become the guitar family.  One day, when I am rich, I will pick it back up.

If you go through my ipod, you will either conclude that I am a middle-aged Julliard alumnus, a psychedelic voodoo chile, or an angry 19 year old lesbian.  

I have about 20 guitars, many of which I have modified extensively.  In high school, instead of practicing scales, I played guitar like it was a very weak AC generator.

I am a moderator on [r/coding.](http://www.reddit.com/r/coding)

I've done a little traveling, but I have never lived abroad.  I plan on living in each of the BRIC countries before I die.

I vote with my wallet.  When I see a used book store, I go in and buy a math book, just so that used book stores will carry math books.

I do some technical work for my friend's literary magazine [Broad!](http://www.broadzine.com)  It's a great publication, and I am proud to be a part of it.

I am not a vegan, but I cook like one.
