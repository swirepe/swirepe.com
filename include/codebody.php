<p>I write a lot of code.</p>
<p>I write unreasonable amounts of code.</p>
<p>I code for work, for fun, and for the sake of it.</p>
<p>In high school, I built a cluster out of computers I found in the garbage.</p>
<p>In college, I started in towards machine learning. My favorite project from back then was a Galaga-esque game, where the enemy creatures got better through natural selection.</p>
<p>In grad school, I made some friends through OkCupid. I dumped every profile in a 50 mile radius into a database.</p>
<p>I have about 60 Project Euler problems done, although I haven't worked on them in a while. I hope to place in my first Kaggle competition by the end of this year.</p>
<p>There's a lot of code that I can't share (student models, etc), but I'd be happy to chat about it with you. If you have any interesting data to mine, algorithms to analyze, or languages to learn, <a href="/contact">send me an email.</a></p>
