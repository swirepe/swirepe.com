<h1 id="some-things-about-me">Some things about me</h1>
<p>My name is Peter Swire.</p>
<p>I wrote a relational calculus to help optimize my grocery shopping. That is the kind of thing I do for fun.</p>
<p>I am in a punk band with my brother. I play a hanna montana guitar, because that's what punk is.</p>

<p>My solo band is called State Machine.</p>
<p>The superhero I most relate with is Desolation Jones. My favorite is The Tick.</p>
<p>I double-majored in Computer Science and music.</p>
<p>For one of my performance requirements, I was not allowed to play guitar; I had to play my computer with my guitar plugged into it. I got pretty good at coding new and interesting effects. If you find me on r/guitar, I'll probably write you one.</p>
<p>I also play the viola da gamba. It's an extinct instrument that later went on to become the guitar family. One day, when I am rich, I will pick it back up.</p>
<p>I have about 20 guitars, many of which I have modified extensively. In high school, instead of practicing scales, I played guitar like it was a very weak AC generator.</p>
<p>I am a moderator on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/coding">r/coding.</a></p>
<p>I've done a little traveling, but I have never lived abroad. I plan on living in each of the BRIC countries before I die.</p>
<p>I vote with my wallet. When I see a used book store, I go in and buy a math book, just so that used book stores will carry math books.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.broadzine.com/about/">Broad!</a> is my favorite magazine. My friend saw that no publications did what she needed, so she started one.</p>
<p>I am not a vegan, but I cook like one.</p>
