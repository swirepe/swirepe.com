<p>I read somewhere that spammers were able to pass the Turing Test, but only in the context of &quot;adult chat rooms.&quot; People would spend hours chatting with bots they thought were ladies.</p>
<p>I wrote a program that crawled the web and ranked &quot;adult images&quot; according to some heuristics. It posted the best ones online. At it's peak, it had about 5,000 followers and got more fan-mail than I was willing to read. I don't think anybody realized it wasn't a person.</p>
<p>Inappropriamatic is no longer maintained.</p>
