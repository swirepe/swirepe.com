				<p>Hi, my name is Peter Swire.  </p>
                
                <p>I think about how machines think.  </p>
                <p>My professional interests include human-interpretable models, 
                	probability theory, and anything that could be described as
                	<i>Markovian</i> or <i>Bayesian</i>.  </p>

            	<p>I am especially excited by the intersection of data and people.</p>

            	<p> I spent two years making statistical models of how middle school
            		 kids learn math. As part of my research, I spent one day a week 
            		 in Bellingham Memorial Middle School. BMMS was an "at risk" school,
            		 according to the No Child Left Behind act. Every child that I proposed
            		 a data-driven intervention for increased their MCAS score.</p>

            		 <p>One time, I watched a kid "invent" divison.  That is my proudest moment.</p>

                <p>My non-professional interests include guitars, feminism, and guitars.</p>
